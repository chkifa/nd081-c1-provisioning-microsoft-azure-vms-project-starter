### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*

cost:
VMs are more expensive to run in comparison to Azure App Service.
App Services do not offer Pay-as-you-Go. Hence, you’re paying for the service plan, even if you’re not using it.

scalability:
VMs are preferred for apps, which have scope to expand for future.

availability:
VMs offer developer more control over the environment. 
Like, one can’t choose underlying OS of VM in an Azure App Service.

workflow:
App Service requires much less managerial efforts in comparison to VMs. 
And development of app is much simpler and faster.

- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*

app service

- *Justify your choice*
- 
for this project my choice is app service because it is quick to deploy and does not require too much effort.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.*
